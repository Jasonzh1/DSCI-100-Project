    "The 1990s saw a major economic boom in the US. Fueled by a tech boom, the economy grew at 3% with low unemployment and 2 million new jobs. While income increased in 1994, minorities and women still faced significant wage inequality (Wilson, 2016). This highlights that economic prosperity didn't necessarily translate to equal pay for all groups.\r\n",

    "#### *Expected Findings*\n",
    "- More younger people have an annual income greater than 50,000 dollars due to results also showing them having longer years of formal education.\n",
    "- More non-white, female, immigrants are likely to have an annual income of less than 50,000 compared to white, male, native US residents.\n",
    "- More non-white, female, immigrants work longer hours than white, male, native US residents despite having a lower income.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Impact of Findings*\n",
    "The results of the suggested findings can be compared to modern-day statistics to determine if the annual income for different races, sex, age, and native groups has changed. Modern findings may suggest a decrease in wage inequality between race and sex groups, allowing us to identify what changes were made. If modern stats show immigrants making an annual income more comparable to native US residents than in 1994, the government can use it as a way of attracting migrants to the country. If in 2024, data shows younger generations having more years of formal education compared to older generations, the government can advertise a rise in education levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Future Questions*\n",
    "- Is formal education an important way to increase annual income in 2024 compared to 30 years ago?\n",
    "- Has the wage gap between different races, sex, and resident groups in the United States changed in the last 30 years?\n",
    "- Are US immigrants likely to receive financial support comparable to native US residents in 2024?"
